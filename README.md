This is UKUI Menu, a fork of [MintMenu](https://github.com/linuxmint/mintmenu).

  * UKUI Menu is a new style startup menu.

Personally I'm not the least bit interested in using the UKUI Menu but I 
see that it is regularly requested in the Ubuntu Ukui community. So 
consider UKUI Menu a gift from me, to you :-)

UKUI Menu needs translators!
